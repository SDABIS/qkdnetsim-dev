    The Network Simulator, Version 3 + QKD
    --------------------------------

QKDNetSim+: Improvement of the Quantum Network Simulator for NS-3

The first Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks are currently being deployed, but the implementation cost is still prohibitive for most researchers. As such, there is a need for realistic QKD network simulators. The QKDNetSim module for the network simulator NS-3 focuses on the representation of packets and the management of key material in a QKD network, but contains numerous conceptual and implementation limitations that prevent it from faithfully representing the behaviour of a real quantum network.

This repository contains an enhanced version of QKDNetSim, in which its shortcomings related to key management are overcome. Our implementation of an improved QKDNetSim maintains the module's overall structure while correcting the conceptual and implementation flaws of the Key Buffer, Cryptography Handler and Simulated Quantum Channel. We also provide the option of employing a real QRNG as a source of randomness for the Simulated Quantum Channel.
